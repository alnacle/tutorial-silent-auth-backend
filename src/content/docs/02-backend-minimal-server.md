# Backend: A Minimal Server

Before adding any Vonage logic, let's get a working Express server running. This gives you a fast feedback loop: make a change, save the file, and the server restarts automatically.

---

## How auto-reload works in Codespaces

**nodemon** is pre-installed in this Codespaces environment. It watches your `server.js` file and restarts the Node.js process every time you save a change. You don't need to install anything or stop/start the server manually during this tutorial — just save and nodemon handles the rest.

---

## Create `server.js`

Inside the `workspace/` folder, open the file called `server.js` and add the following:

```js
const express = require("express");
const cors = require("cors");

const app = express();

app.use(cors());
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

app.get("/health", (req, res) => {
  res.json({ status: "ok" });
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Backend listening on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

What this does:

- `cors()` — allows the Android app to call this API from a different origin
- `express.json()` — parses incoming JSON request bodies
- `GET /health` — a simple endpoint to confirm the server is running
- Port **3000** — the default; can be overridden with a `PORT` environment variable

---

## Test the health endpoint


Your project already uses `nodemon` to auto-reload `server.js`, so there is no need to manually restart the process. Save the file. You should see it restart automatically in the terminal:

```
[nodemon] restarting due to changes...
[nodemon] starting `node server.js`
Backend listening on port 3000
```

Open a **second terminal** and run:


```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

Expected response:

```json
{ "status": "ok" }
```

If you see that response, the server is working correctly.

## Checkpoint

- [ ] `workspace/server.js` exists
- [ ] `nodemon server.js` starts without errors
- [ ] `curl http://localhost:3000/health` returns `{ "status": "ok" }`
- [ ] Saving a change to `server.js` triggers an automatic restart
